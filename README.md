# Naive Bayes Tweet Recognizer

This project implements a simple **Naive Bayes classifier** to recognize and classify tweets based on their content. It is a machine learning project focused on text classification, using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and scikit-learn tools.

## Features

- Preprocesses tweets (tokenization, cleaning, etc.)
- Trains a Naive Bayes classifier on labeled tweet data
- Evaluates the classifierâ€™s accuracy
- Predicts the class of new, unseen tweets

## Project Structure

- `naive_bayes_tweet_recognizer.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Data loading
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Model training
  - Model evaluation
  - Example predictions

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `naive_bayes_tweet_recognizer.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the cells step-by-step:
   - Load your data (or use the sample provided)
   - Train the Naive Bayes model
   - Evaluate performance
   - Test the model on new inputs
